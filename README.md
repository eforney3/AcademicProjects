# ðŸŒ± Academic Projects Overview

## Stochastic Processes: Graph Theory Applications & Monte Carlo Simulation
- Collaborated with 2 classmates for PSTAT 160B final project.
- Technologies used: Python.

Analyzed the solution to a key math problem in the movie Good Will Hunting, connecting concepts from graph theory, stochastic processes, and probability. Implemented a Monte Carlo simulation experiment to visualize the cover times of various graphs and examine what graph properties minimize/maximize the cover time.

## Time Series Analysis: Forecasting Temperatures
- Individual PSTAT 174 final project.
- Technologies used: R.

Built a SARIMA model using Box-Jenkins methodology to forecast monthly temperatures at Nottingham Castle, England with a 95% confidence interval. Performed diagnostic checking of candidate models by visualizing and examining the residuals. Ensured validity of final model by comparing forecast with the test data.

## Machine Learning: Predicting 2016 Presidential Election Winner
- Collaborated with 3 classmates for PSTAT 131 final project.
- Technologies used: R.

Constructed and optimized a random forest model using R with 3 classmates to predict, at a county level, which 2016 USA presidential candidate receives the most votes. Cleaned raw election data to improve model accuracy by dropping redundant variables that are highly correlated, converting units, and aggregating data to a county level. Selected final model by comparing misclassification rate of trained and tested classification models: logistic regression, k-nearest neighbors, classification tree, and random forest.
